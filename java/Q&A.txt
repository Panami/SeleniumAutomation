1)What is Java explain?
java is widley used object oriented programing language and software platform & secure programming language.
Features of Java?
Simple
Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand.
Object-oriented
Java is an object-oriented
programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.
Platform Independent
Java is platform independent
Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C
, C++
, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.
Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).
Secured
Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:

No explicit pointer
Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
Robust
The English mining of Robust is strong. Java is robust because:

It uses strong memory management.
There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.
Portable
Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.
Multi-threaded
A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.

2)Data Types in Java?
Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, araaylist, String, hashmap and Arrays .1)What is Java explain?
