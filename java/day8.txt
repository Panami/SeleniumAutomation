Interfaces
--------------
An interface in java is a blueprint of class.
Interface contains final and static variables.
Interface contains abstract methods.
An abstract method is a method contains definition but not a body.
methods in interfaces are public by default.
interface supports the  functionality of multiple interfaces.
we can define interface with interface keyword.
A class extends lass, an interface extends another interface but class impliments an interface.
we can create object reference for interfacebut we can not instantiate interface.



package is collection of classes/interfaces/other files.

import

create sub package
2types of packages
------------------
1.user defined packages
2.built-in packages

Access modifiers : dfine the scope of varaibles and methods
-----------------
1.public
2.protected
3.default
4.private

private: the private access modifier is accessible only within the class.

default: If you dont use any modifier, its treated as the default modifier by default.
         The default access modifier is accessible only within the package.

protected:the protected access modifuer is accessible within the package and out side the package but through inheritance only.


public: we can acess anywhere 
	A class, method or variable can be declared as public and it means that it is accessible from any class
        A public class, method, or variable can be accessed from any other class at any time
