OOP- object oriented programming.


class-->collection of variables and methods
object-->object is an instance of a class
method-->block of code which contains a logic

1)main() method can be present in a same class
2)main() method can be present in a saparate class

class varibles
------------
we can assign values to variables in 3ways
1)by using reference variable
2)by using method
3)by using constuctore

constuctore
--------
1)constuctore a special type of method
2)constuctore udes for initilizing the class variabls
3)constuctore name should be same as class name
4)constuctore will not return any value(not even void
5)constuctore will be invoked at the time of object creation



method-->Block of code
--------------
1)case1-not taking parameters and also not returned any value
2)case2-not taking parameters but returning value
3)case3-taking parameters, but not returning any value
4)case4-method is taking parameters and also returning values


type of constructor
------------
1)default  Constructor:A constructor is called "Default Constructor" when it doesn't have any parameter.
2)parameter Constructor:A constructor which has a specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
